# Systemic Connectivity from The Municipalities to University Programs

Now, lets get back to the more crude and unsophisticated ways in which federal money is used, misused and abused within Kitchener-Waterloo Region. 

The federal money routed via the cities of Waterloo and Kitchener finds its way to Communitech where part of it is disbursed to: programs from UWaterloo like Velocity and University of McMaster programs. For now, let me draw your focus and attention towards Velocity, that happens to be a UWaterloo sponsored program inside Communnitech's building. Velocity program's main purpose has been along the lines of providing business incubation space to local startups which, are usually founded by the UWaterloo's students. Velocity as an anchor tenant in Tannary Building, pays rent to Communitech, and thus the rent along with direct advisory support from university leadership is a very sizable and direct contribution of UWaterloo to Communitech. Facilitating the smooth give and take between the university and regional private conglomerates, is the main purpose of Communitech's existence. Within the physical area of Communitech's building that is rented out to Velocity, a number of selected student startups are given dedicated desks and a few other office-like amenities. The main thing that Velocity takes pride in, in terms of its offering for selected startups, is the set of mentors and coaches hired by Velocity who are supposed to be on-par with any other well-qualified professionals with knowledge and expertise in various aspects of communication, trade, business creation, and project commercialization. 

All seemingly above-board and grand, up until this point. 

So, let us now have a look at the abusive activities of, and the typical ways in which the advice to adopt illegitimate business practices wherever possible, is thrust onto Velocity members by a few mentors and coaches. Those mentors and coaches, hired as employees, were appointed by UWaterloo's leadership to work in Velocity, during the years 2017 - 2020. The administrative group that incubates and invests university resources towards favorable looking startups via Velocity, is comprised of Velocity's employees along with several staff as well as faculty members of UWaterloo, who collectively act as advisors to startups in formal as well as informal capacities. We will now review the activities of few key persons who were part of Velocity's administrative group.

Jay's main qualifications appear to come from his experience as a co-founder of BufferBox. As retold by Jay during a public talk given by him in Communitech: he was instrumental in securing a multi-million dollar exit from BufferBox, by being the key person who promised bomb-detection systems within his company's lock-boxes, to Amazon Inc., which then acquired his company. 

BufferBox had a kiosk interface for lockers with a one time password that was messaged to the registered mobile phone of its subscribing customers. But, BufferBox's physical drop-off sites out on the street, in various cities where the kiosk-lockers were located, were unmanned and not monitored like the P.O.Box lockers in post offices. So, during negotiations on the term sheet, when an Amazon executive asked about hazardous or dangerous things being mailed to a BufferBox site, Jay simply lied to the Amazon exec saying that the each BufferBox locker was going to have bomb-detectors, which were already being tested with some success. Saying this lie, then got them the multi-million dollar buy-out deal, as publicly admitted (bragged) by him during that talk. The talk was during a set of events promoted by Communitech for introducing Jay Shah as the new director of Velocity. During those years, Jay also simultaneously held board memberships in various organizations in the Kitchener-Waterloo Region, like the Waterloo EDC.

I forgot his last name. But that's not important. Brad was an early employee of BufferBox, so when Jay Shah became director of Velocity, Brad was appointed as a paid employee of Velocity, in the formal capacity of a business coach/mentor. So no cronyism there, right? 

Any ways, Brad's job was to provide assistance to founders of startups incubated in Velocity, within the context of business challenges faced by those founders, and also to give the usual pep-talk to founders with business related catch-phrases, and buzzwords.

Crista was (is) a UWaterloo graduate, with a master's degree in "Peace and Conflict Studies" along with a focus on "Conflict Resolution." She was also a startup founder in the region at some point in her career. The conflict between Crista Renner as a mentor and my startup, which was a part of Velocity in 2017, went something like this â€”
