## 3. Systemic Connectivity from The Municipalities to University Programs

Now, lets get back to the more crude and unsophisticated ways in which Canada's federal money is used, misused, and abused within Kitchener-Waterloo Region. 

The federal money routed via the cities of Waterloo and Kitchener finds its way to Communitech where part of it is disbursed to: programs from UWaterloo like Velocity, as well as other programs of McMaster and Wilfrid Laurier Universities. For now, let me draw your focus and attention towards Velocity, that happens to be a UWaterloo sponsored program inside Communitech's building. Velocity program's main purpose has been along the lines of providing business incubation space to local startups which, are usually founded by the UWaterloo's students. 

Velocity, as an anchor tenant in the Tannery Building, pays rent to Communitech, and thus the rent along with direct advisory support from university leadership is a very sizable, and is a direct contribution from UWaterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, to Communitech, Kitchener, Ontario. Facilitating the smooth give and take between the university and regional private conglomerates, is the main purpose of Communitech's existence. 

Within the physical area of Communitech's building that is rented out to Velocity, a number of selected student startups are given dedicated desks and a few other office-like amenities. The main thing that Velocity takes pride in, in terms of its special services provided to selected startups, has been the set of mentors and coaches hired by Velocity who provide consultation to startup founders. Those Velocity employees who play the role of mentors and coaches, are advertised as being on-par with any other well-qualified engineering and business professionals, with knowledge and expertise in various aspects of communication, trade, business creation, technology management, product management, project commercialization, and business growth. 

All seemingly above-board and grand, up until this point. 

So, let us now have a look at the abusive activities of, and the typical ways in which the advice to adopt illegitimate business practices wherever possible, is thrust onto founders incubated in Velocity by a few mentors and coaches. Those mentors and coaches, hired as employees, were appointed by UWaterloo's leadership to work in Velocity, during the years 2017 - 2020. The administrative group that governs the overall program, and invests university resources towards favorable looking startups via Velocity, is comprised of Velocity's employees along with several staff as well as faculty members of UWaterloo. These administrative members collectively act as advisors to startups in formal, as well as informal capacities. We will now review the activities of few key persons who were part of Velocity's administrative group. 

<details><summary><h3>a) Brad</h3></summary>

I forgot his last name. But that's not important. Brad was an early employee of BufferBox, so when Jay Shah became director of Velocity, Brad was appointed as a paid employee of Velocity, in the formal capacity of a business coach/mentor. So no cronyism there, right? 

Any ways, Brad's job was to provide assistance to founders of startups incubated in Velocity, within the context of business challenges faced by those founders, and also to give the usual pep-talk to founders with business related catch-phrases, and buzzwords. 

- Brad was all about "the bro-culture", and loved to share business quotes from Twitter, which were utterly useless for most founders trying to work on their technology intensive business ventures. So the male founders had come up with either of two ways, in dealing with the daily and weekly disturbances created by Brad. 

    - One was to ask him point blank, if he needed anything from us, and if he didn't, we would simply ask him to go away. 

    - The other way was to, "'shoot the hay' with Brad, as bros." 

        Some of the male founders had figured out that if they entertained Brad with some flattery about his chicken farm, for fifteen or twenty minutes, he would leave them alone for the rest of the week. Brad thought of himself as an 'entrepreneur' in the agriculture industry and poultry farming sector, because he loved his chicken farm and was able to supply 50 to 60 free-range eggs, to a few customers in and around Kitchener, once every two or three weeks. Each egg sold by Brad was more than $4.00 Canadian dollars, depending on the week's supply. Compared to the eggs sold in grocery stores that were $0.80 dollars each, and the ones in the Kitchener Farmers' Market that were $1.30 each; Brad had a nifty business operation going on with his free-range chickens.  

- Brad was also super enthusiastic about providing a pep-talk to all startup founders but, he was far more enthusiastic about bullying women entrepreneurs. Each day, Brad would show up for an hour or two at Velocity, walk around like a pit-boss, and then re-assign the desks allocated to few female students of UWaterloo who were working out of Velocity. He would keep shuffling them around, for no reason what-so-ever.  

- Sadly, one of the female founders who used to have a desk next to us in Velocity, eventually got fed up with Brad taking her personal stuff and tossing it in some other corner of Velocity's co-working space, every other week. So, she simply quit and left Velocity.

<details><summary><h3>b) Crista Renner</h3></summary>

Crista was (is) a UWaterloo graduate, with a master's degree in "Peace and Conflict Studies" along with a focus on "Conflict Resolution." She was also a startup founder in the region at some point in her career. The conflict between Crista Renner as a mentor and my startup, which was a part of Velocity in 2017, went something like this — 

- Crista would come each week to our desk in Velocity, and talk to us about how my co-founder and I needed to be more 'scrappy.' The first two weeks Crista told us that, I didn't understand what it meant, so I didn't think much of it. During the third week Crista came by our desks, she was particularly cross with us, she spoke to us about how our business performance wasn't up to the expectation of Velocity mentors (herself and Brad) because we weren't 'scrappy' enough. So I asked her what we needed to scrap from our desk, or from our business model. To which she replied that we needed to be more *scrappy* with our customers and then she went away. 

- A few days later Crista again came to us, but this time to clarify what she had meant during previous conversations. I believe this was because I had spoken to Jay Shah (Velocity's in-charge and Director) that Crista's advice to us made no sense, and her constant badgering with meaningless instructions kept disrupting our daily workflow. So this time around, Crista explained to my co-workers and I, that she expected us to be "go-getters", and to be more 'scrappy.' When I asked her how were we supposed to be scrappy, she explained that we needed to acquire more customers by joining Facebook groups for persons living with Alzheimer's, and then after taking the personal contacts of people from those online groups, we were to cold-call each of them about our business offering. 

- At that point I became very irritated with Crista and told her that it was already illegal in Canada, to acquire private contact details of persons using phishing and stalking techniques. She said that it wasn't illegal to secretly get private information of people by joining their Facebook groups. She also said that *if we didn't show the initiative to be more aggressive and 'scrappy' in our customer acquisition strategy, then it meant that we were too soft, and that we did not deserve to be in Velocity.* 

- As annoyed as I was from hearing that word again (scrappy); I couldn't do anything about it at that moment. So I politely told Crista that we would continue to do our work in accordance with our business standards, and with the necessary respect that our customers deserved, even if it meant leaving Velocity for good. 

- It was evident that Crista was merely regurgitating the phrase about being scrappy, which was embedded in her by her coaches and mentors from the region. 

- When that 'tough conversation' with Crista was finally over, and after she returned to her office, I looked up the word, "scrappy person." It means, 

    >"a person who is ready and willing for a fight; a brawler." 

    This made much less sense to me back then, compared to what I had thought it meant, because it made me wonder why were my co-founder and I expected to be like brawlers — with elderly clients who have Alzheimer's! For quite a few minutes that day, I wondered, "why would anybody want to get 'scrappy' with elderly caregivers of people living with dementia?" 
    
    The elderly spouse and adult children of people with severe memory challenges were our main point of contact for a client, and they were also the primary end-users of our startup services. They were already physically and financially worn thin due to stresses of caring for their terminally ill family member. Why would anybody want to add to their troubles by getting scruffy with them like a cheap used-car salesman, or a petty pickpocket in a dark alley? 

- Was there some kind of a communication gap between Crista Renner, and my team, during those weekly conversations? Was there a misunderstanding? No. 

It is no mistake when a person with authority repeatedly instructs you to do illegal things with threats of doing harm to you for not obeying. The type of repeated hostile behavior demonstrated by Crista Renner, in strongly inducing other people to do unethical or illegal things, is a habitual violation committed by those who have gotten accustomed to abusing their position of authority with impunity. Such violators know perfectly well that 'the establishment' they are a part of, will come to their rescue and protect them, regardless of the abuses they commit, as long as they remain 'loyal' to the establishment's culture of exploiting the confidence of unassuming people entrusted to their care.

<details><summary><h3>c) Jay Shah</h3></summary>

Jay's main qualifications appear to come from his experience as a co-founder of BufferBox, where Brad worked along with Jay as his right-hand man. 

As retold by Jay during a public talk given by him in Communitech: he was personally responsible and instrumental, in securing a multi-million dollar exit from BufferBox, by being the key person who promised bomb-detection systems within his company's lock-boxes, to Amazon Inc., which then acquired his company. 

BufferBox had a kiosk interface for lockers with a digital key in the form of a one time password, that was messaged to the registered mobile phone of its subscribing customers. But, BufferBox's physical drop-off sites out on the street, in various cities where the kiosk-lockers were located, were unmanned and not monitored like the P.O.Box lockers in post offices. So, during negotiations on the acquisition term sheet offered by Amazon Inc., when an Amazon executive asked about hazardous or dangerous things being mailed to a BufferBox site, Jay simply lied to the Amazon exec saying that each BufferBox locker was going to have *bomb-detectors, which were already being tested with some success.* Saying this lie, then got them the multi-million dollar buy-out deal, as publicly admitted (bragged) by him during that talk. The talk was during a set of events promoted by Communitech for introducing Jay Shah as the new director of Velocity. During those years, Jay also simultaneously held board memberships in various organizations in the Kitchener-Waterloo Region, like the Waterloo EDC.
