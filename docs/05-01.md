## 5.1 Not to King Edward

Dear Edward,

This is to express my disappointment with The Accelerator Center's organizational culture, that has continuously failed to prioritize the health and safety of startup founders incubated through The Accelerator Center (The AC). Worse, The AC has repeatedly diminished, and downplayed the need for caring about people impacted by the business models adopted by its incubated startups. 

When it comes to proving the legitimacy and worth of the region's technology startups, The AC is generally viewed as a more mature startup incubation space, with greater integrity than the Velocity program housed in Commnitech. However, The AC has remained the same as Velocity and MBET, when it comes to promoting ideas in favor of conducting gray-area activities, to gain customer traction and revenue streams. 

Edward, you being a man who has worked in the locomotive industry, must have known all too well that even small flaws, infractions, and errors can interact in non-linear ways, to create catastrophic impacts on people's lives. As such, you should have known better to have let A. J. run wild for years, with his gambling based approach to company incubation involving AC members, incubated founders, and previous directors of Velocity. 

A. J.'s elder brother T. J., could have also identified the above-mentioned issues, and stopped A. J. from steering The AC into becoming a gambling rink, sooner rather than later. But, perhaps, years of mismanagement of The AC need to be forgiven and forgotten, while bearing in mind that the lessons learned from those unfortunate years, were at the expense of numerous community members and newcomers. Of course, doing so remains a bit difficult, given that The AC still does not pay heed to having incubated members prove the physical safety, and legal standards of integrity needed of their ventures, before pushing founders towards reckless designs of exponential growth based revenue models, and hazardous business practices. 

Your inability, or hesitance, in appropriately applying your influence to rectify problematic issues intrinsic to The AC, and inherent in its affiliated groups like Velocity, Communitech, and MBET, are bound to cause more severe challenges for the University of Waterloo. 

Lastly, in this open letter (of sorts), the reader may also recognize, "The Systemic Connectivity Among Private-Public Startup Incubators Affiliated to UWaterloo." There isn't a way to remedy the wrongs perpetrated in one part of the business ecosystem in Kitchener-Waterloo Region of Ontario, Canada, without properly redressing the faulty cultural norms and values embodied by the entire province's ecosystem. 

Some of those faulty norms and social practices include: ignoring or diminishing the economic value of labor performed by carers, particularly women carers within family units; de-prioritizing accessibility and special needs of differently abled persons; marginalizing the labors and intellectual efforts of newcomers by ignoring, or diminishing their good credit history and proper professional credentials earned from their home country; denying access to legal resources and legal aid to individual workers, and viciously hampering free-association of persons by denying them the right to unionize; promoting polluting industries that cause ecological devastation; encouraging founders to commit fraudulent actions to gain credence and money of customers using false pretexts, and falsehoods; promoting looting and pilfering of private and confidential data, of consumers and by-standers; propagating a culture of servility and bribery to gain socio-economic favors from political authority figures, via overt lobbying as well as other clandestine means; engendering racism, bigotry, Islamophobia, misogyny, gender-based pay gaps, and stigmatization of low-income families, through institutionalized policies and protocols; committing outright theft of equity through unfair trade deals and improper employment practices; and continued cultural misappropriations in the name of assimilation or modernization.
