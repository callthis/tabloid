## 1.1 Business Ecosystem Surrounding Greater Toronto Area 

Toronto is where the most important financial decisions and deals concerning Ontario, Canada, are made within its high-rise offices, fancy get-togethers, and exclusive restaurants. Ottawa is far removed from the daily activities of Toronto. The international embassies in Ottawa also do not have any direct overview of the socio-economic systems and subsystems, that cluster in and around Toronto. The consulates of various countries in Greater Toronto Area (GTA) function to serve the standard business needs of various persons. And those consulates, generally do not have a detailed view of the struggles faced by their citizens in frontier cities of GTA, like Oshawa and Kitchener. 

The ideal company to join the tech-scene in GTA which, can be poised to become a unicorn, typically has at least one **blue-sky component.** A blue-sky component is an aspect of the company's business model that is novel and profit generating, and most crucially, happens to be outside the reach of regulatory authorities and judiciary systems. If every aspect of a company's financial, customer acquisition, labor policy, competitive protection, as well as main technological foothold are outside the knowledge and understanding of existing legal statutes, then, the company's investors 'legally' gain: a royal-flush blue-sky project. Such a blue-sky project achieves primacy and does not need to contend with dominance within a market, so much so that regulators give the project owners free reign to "self-regulate", and to set the required industry standards for ethics, usability, design, as well as the outlook of any commercially 'viable and laudable' products or services, created by the royal blue-sky team with its *blue-ocean strategies.*  

Which capitalist or monarch, even after being glutinously stuffed with their windfall earnings from the S&P 500 and other hedge funds, does not crave for the next level of 'creative destruction' that will completely upend at least one industry of the globalized economy? Wouldn't you, unless you are satiated with your level of earnings, jump for an opportunity to invest in a profit generating company, that cannot be touched for the next 20 years, by any government regulations and other social justice advocacy groups? How about one that cannot be touched by international regulatory boards for a 30 year horizon? And just in case, some kind of regulatory hurdles, or any one of "Porter's Five Forces" threaten to reduce the profit margins of such a company's blue-sky project, there can always be a number of ways to introduce glossy marketing and endless series of counterfactual expert reports, from well-known consulting and lobbying firms like Boston Consulting Group, or Pricewaterhouse Coopers; to keep generating profits till "the cow" can be replaced with some other "shooting star." Doing so keeps the competitive edge of the blue-sky project sharp enough to slash and burn through natural resources, for a few more years, before a Carl Icahn, or a Ralph Nader, or a Robert Muller type 'player' catches up to the project's boardroom members. And even those kinds of old-timer activists or players, can't outlast the market itself! So, blue-sky projects are the most sought after investment opportunities, especially by, and for, those who possess a 'frontier-spirit.' 

By the time even an agency such as the European Court of Justice (ECJ) implements a penalizing ruling against wrongful practices of a company with blue-sky projects, the fines or penalties imposed on the company turn out to be like getting slapped on the wrist with a feather â€” even when the fines are in hundreds of millions of Euros. This is because profit generating blue-sky teams rake-in billions per year, and a loss of a few hundred million during a financial year is hardly a distinct line item, in the annual balance sheet reported to financiers. Large hedge funds and holding companies that earn revenues from multiple companies, each with multiple blue-sky projects of their own, simply assess the judiciary penalties levied on any one of their subsidiaries as, "cost of doing business." 

As such, the investor community in the province of Ontario, as well as those from its neighboring regions in the US, are convinced that the next Westinghouse is only going to show up for a partnership with the next, eccentric Nicola; and the next General Electric is only going to be created by a culture of ruthlessness promoted by the next, pioneering Thomas. So, increasing the likelihood that the gamble on high-risk ventures pays off for the province's investment groups, naturally requires a large, internationally well-frequented casino, I mean, a well-reputed technological and financial hub, that allows finders of winning bets to become keepers, and those of losing bets to become weepers. After all is said and done, that is the only natural law of competitive selection that counts, and is fair, isn't it?

The main ~~casino~~ technology hub for startups and budding companies in Canada is the "MaRS Discovery District", which is located within Toronto's scenic and famous downtown area, close to the University of Toronto. MaRS Discovery District is where a tech-company gets to be housed when it has learned the essence of orchestrating a resource grab, and has mastered the art of usurpation. Once resources of customers or other vested stakeholders have been grabbed and spent, what can those stakeholders possibly do? Once permanent ecological damage and extensive cultural misappropriations have been committed, what can any stakeholder ever do in its aftermath? What can they do other than to keep pouring good money after bad, and keep increasing their sunk costs in a sullen way? Or, do you think robed people can simply cut their losses, and walk away with a few scraps of their remaining dignity? Perhaps, wronged stakeholders could seek damages, but how? Please do considering these questions in the context of when "a land grab", within a socio-economic system, is orchestrated by someone who forcefully usurps authority while using bullying, deception, and clout, via gerrymandering, bribery, and fake forms of "network effect" obtained by *[astroturfing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing)* or hoodwinking the public.

Therefore, the basic trick taught to founders of growing companies to exponentially accelerate their revenues is: 

1. Quickly cover up the resource grab along with its extensive road-kill by normalizing it as, "entrepreneurial experiments for exploring or validating the 'known-unknowns, and unknown-unknowns'." 

1. Use private foundations and "non-government organizations" for doing some charity work to gain more clout. 

1. And then use paid media outlets to make the wronged people's outcry look like, "wishy-washy, baseless tantrums of crybabies and haters." 

So, how can wronged stakeholders and wrongfully injured bystanders do anything against the responsible and liable corporate entities, when the damages done to private persons, and to public spaces, by those corporate entities, are made to look like "water under the bridge" with a petty amount of "spilled milk?" What indeed can wronged and suffering persons possibly do in the aftermath of irreparable damages?  

Although it can be fascinatingly expensive, paying into the GTA ecosystem and joining the gambling-house of exponential growths can have its perks. Company executives can get to be more closely aligned with and linked to the insider knowledge streaming from US based venture capital firms, particularly if their companies are situated in the MaRS Discovery District, and if they happen to frequent its nearby watering-holes. 

The powers that be, within GTA, are completely enamored by the 'laissez faire' attitude of founders from places like the Bay Area in California. Consequently, the venerable pundits of USA like Seth Godin and Guy Kawasaki, train the technocrats of GTA, during leadership summits, coaching seminars, and networking events held regularly at venues like MaRS Discovery District. Those converted and trained technocrats in turn, evangelize to the poor and uninitiated masses of GTA's borderlands and frontier regions like Kitchener. 

However, what inevitably settles into the mindset of the leadership in places like Communitech of Kitchener, Ontario, is more along the lines of, "allow business owners to do as they please as long as they make revenues. Don't be 'a sourpuss or a Rick Grimes', don't let ethics or fiduciary duties get in the way of increasing revenues by hook, or by crook."
