## 4. Segregationism 

**The Greenhouse**

UWaterloo's Greenhouse program that also provides training and courses on venture creation, **is deliberately segregated,** and kept far away from the Velocity Program, and from MBET's coursework, students, founding members, and fundraisers. 

The Greenhouse's approach towards startups is to have student founders focus on more pertinent questions, about why a venture ought to be created in the first place, aside from its financial profit generating potential. This type of a focus or approach is somehow seen as a poison-pill for MBET, Velocity, and The Accelerator Center, by the regional and provincial directors of various organizations in Ontario, Canada. 

You may agree that within an ecosystem, understanding the nature of systematically linked entities also requires an understanding of systematically decoupled and segregated entities. 

So, indeed, one of the reasons for why MBET coursework has remained ineffective and illegitimate for all these years, has to do with this form of segregation: 

- The type of energy, focus, material, and social support that members of The Greenhouse could have brought to MBET, has been deliberately removed from the primary interests of UWaterloo's Conrad ~~Center~~ School. It is plainly obvious that MBET's vested interests in providing a continuously increasing financial return on investment, to its financiers, founding members, and early employees through every laudable as well as inglorious set of practices that can be made to appear legal, has been prioritized over the best interests and concerns of students; **especially at the cost of, and detriment to serving the best interests of the university's international students.**

The above observation isn't merely my point of view. The physical, social, and resource based separation that has been deliberately created and maintained by UWaterloo's leadership, between the university's two entrepreneurship themed programs, namely, The Greenhouse and MBET, provides clear evidence of segregationism. This type of segregation deliberately caters to the Conrad ~~Center's~~ School's need for chasing the dream of producing startup unicorns, that can be built upon components of *blue-sky projects, and blue-ocean strategies.*

Plus, a proper school within a modern university needs to demonstrate that its axioms, philosophies, and standards are sufficiently impactful in a positive sense and are needed by society, which cannot otherwise be obtained from any other school operating in the university, in order to justify its existence as an autonomous school. So, is there somebody in any part of the world, who can prove that 'entrepreneurship as a school of thought' has unique and original principles, models, academic theories, and literature that don't otherwise exist in any of the schools or colleges of humanities, sciences, and the arts?   

Therefore, a legitimate and accredited graduate program incorporating entrepreneurship as a focus area, needs to be housed in a proper school, or a college, or a department of the university â€” in concert with, and not in contradiction to, *the merits of programs like The Greenhouse.*
