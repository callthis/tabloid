Dear Larry, 

You have been included here because your endorsements of MBET, and other such programs of UWaterloo have been, and are still being used for attracting local as well as international students, to buy into those fault ridden programs. It is for you to decide whether your endorsements of such programs have been misused or abused, in any fashion, by its executive members. 

I mean, it's not like for decades, Universities Canada simply continued to knowingly peddle experimental certificate programs from various Designated Learning Institutes, as proper master's degrees, right? Oh wait, it has been doing precisely that, and most brazenly. Hmmm, this is quite the big problem, isn't it? 

Also, do you genuinely want to motivate students of the MBET program to be like generals? Do you want students coming out of UWaterloo's haphazard experiments in educational programs, to bear the burden of stars on their shoulders and collars? I'm not being mean spirited or merely rhetorical here. These are genuine and legitimate questions, which require satisfactory answers to be published by UWaterloo, in its marketing materials circulated via its public communications channels. 

However, and more importantly, I would like to encourage you to work on the *most difficult problem faced by capitalists,* because you might be the only one who may bother to care about, and understand the following: 

>The biggest problem faced by capitalists and capitalism is summarized by a single word, that is, **reparations.**

In defining the reparations owed to indigenous, and First Nations peoples, killed or harmed via state-sponsored institutions like healthcare facilities, and "residential schools" of Canada, the Canadian Human Rights Commission proposed a miserably low value for human worth. It consequently set the precedent for the lives of each and every Canadian to be equated to, the pathetic monetary sum of: $40,000 CAD. 

That sum of money happens to be less than the tuition fee for MBET, and even less than the yearly fees paid by any undergraduate student in UWaterloo. So, the federal government of Canada has essentially signaled to the world that the entire life, along with the socio-economic potential of a person, especially of those who are Canadians, happens to be a measly sum of $40,000 CAD. Furthermore, such a pathetic amount is to be paid to survivors and families of victims, whose lives were destroyed by state-sponsored violators, only after those survivors have reached a situation in life where they cannot even utilize any reparations. That is, such a sum only needs to be paid out in a non-fungible form, after 60 or 70 years of apathetic delays, and lousy excuses made by the government.

Don't you suppose that there are 'stately people' in this world, who can place a few dozen billion dollars in an escrow account, and promise to pay it to Canada after 70 years, to then go ahead and rape, molest, kill, or destroy the lives of a few hundred thousand Canadians?

In the context of actual reparations owed to wronged peoples: 

```
Aren't the long-term damages to cultural heritage and misappropriated natural resources, 
which belonged to the victims of state-sponsored violations, also to be taken into account, 
for determining the compensations that need to be rightly provided to survivors?
``` 

The solution to the problem of reparations, that needs to include equitable treatment of all peoples with uniform application of social equality via implemented legal statutes, must also include a cap on the ever increasing and burdensome tuition fees of educational programs. 

One needs to investigate why graduate degrees from universities like University of Toronto, Wilfrid Laurier University, and UWaterloo, aren't sincerely and cordially marketed to indigenous, and First Nations peoples. Such universities tend to "go all out", while marketing their programs to profiled and targeted individuals from countries with developing economies. Why is that? 

The pieces of data brought to light here, point to deliberate institutional activities that erect barriers against underprivileged and politically, or socio-economically marginalized groups and individuals. These pieces of data are are being provided for a discussion about the situation of newcomers, as well as indigenous and First Nations peoples in Canada. A serious consideration of these points must yield an actionable plan, with a priority towards betterment of the lives of systematically victimized groups, instead of producing yet another cover up of such problems and issues. For too long in human history, have such issues been ignored or have been sidelined. Entities that have been responsible, liable, and culpable for orchestrating those cover ups, need to put under the spotlight of publicly accountable investigations. 

It is also my humble opinion that conscientious capitalists, who are in support of ecologically sustainable commercialism, might as well utilize reparations as an investment vehicle, to properly distance and separate themselves from predatory as well as parasitic forms of capitalism. For there are many other versions of socio-economic and organizational models, that do not involve predation and parasitism, which can continue to serve humanity and the world's ecology in more meaningful, equitable, sustainable, and worthwhile ways. 

I believe, Prof. Larry, you being conscious and mindful of such topics, could help the Canadian Human Rights Commission to evolve, and thereby produce a much more sensible, and appropriate worldview, regarding the value of the life of a human being. Such awareness could generate worthwhile outcomes towards actual, and timely payments of reparations, which must necessarily include: authentic and genuinely equitable treatment, of all human beings. But the window of opportunity to rescue Canada from devolving due to its hypocrisies, might be fleetingly small.

Canada has yet to demonstrate the decency, and discipline, that a civilized and honorable state would have, in paying its dues to victims of state-sponsored genocides within its territories, in the form of legitimate remedies and reparations.  

So, may I request you to start by looking into the remedies and reparations demanded by Canada from Iran, for those who were killed in, or harmed by a particular airplane crash; as that airplane was accidentally or deliberately shot down by Iran's state-sponsored entities. In the aftermath of that tragic incident, Canada obtained various sums of monies and compensations through official channels from Iran, that were to be distributed to survivors, and to next of kin, of the victims. Canada also obtained a variety of favors through different types of back-channeling and lobbying efforts, for compensating those who were negatively impacted by the event. The souls lost in that plane crash had included a registered student from UWaterloo, for whom the university had worked sincerely, and in solidarity; in order to bring some measure of closure to the victim's bereaved community members, and particularly to her family and close friends. So, this starting point could help in answering the question,

>Is the life of a person from an indigenous, tribal, aboriginal, or a First Nations community, or from any other community for that matter, not worth the same as that of human beings from the so-called upper strata of society? Why or why not?"

You may understand that the insurance industry in North America might not be happy with your findings or recommendations, should you choose to look into such problems and issues; for I trust that you will not pander to insurers and underwriters like Sun-Life, and John-Hancock-Manulife insurance companies. The insurance industry will just have to evolve and keep up with the modern age, won't it? 

Although I am sensing that the option to resign, and run away from UWaterloo, could be more appealing to you as you approach retirement age, I am going to guess that persons like yourself and (Sir) David Johnston, don't ever get to retire from this realm.

One might as well assume that Sisyphus is smiling as he toils. So, I am going to assume that persons like yourself and (Sir) David Johnston, will cheerfully work towards ensuring the proper repayments of restitution, and reparations, that have been long overdue.
