## 5.10 Not to Harry

Dear Harry,

You most probably are aware that you've had to grow up and even build your own family, while sharing your paternal home with a half-sibling called "MBET." We had met on a single occasion, in August 2016, as a result of having to share a dinner table at a Chinese restaurant where you sat next to me, on the left-hand side of your father, who was seated at the head of the table, along with a dozen or so MBET students around the long, long table.  

I genuinely believe that your father took as much care and attention as possible, in creating a business oriented program in UWaterloo, for he recognized a gap in the educational needs of technically oriented students who were graduating from the university, without acquiring a sufficient grasp of business, and organizational skills. While he ran from pillar to post, to make a certificate program into a regularized degree with standard coursework provided by appropriately qualified instructors, he ran into the usual political and financial difficulties of a large organization such as UWaterloo, along with the trials and tribulations arising from the surrounding culture of UWaterloo's neighborhood. 

I believe that is where the problems of the Conrad Center started, at its very inception, due to the artificial scarcity thrust upon new educational program coordinators by UWaterloo, and by the local government. UWaterloo has always had a profitable financial portfolio derived from the investments UWaterloo makes into various markets, using tax-exempt monies from its privately held Foundations. Last I checked, in the Financial Year of 2019, UWaterloo had more than $45 Million CAD invested directly into fossil fuels and crude oils, including shale gas companies. Some of those companies, happen to have board members and executive officers who were, or are still affiliated with UWaterloo-MBET. Additionally, during the past couple of years, UWaterloo would have made windfall earnings from investments in those petroleum companies, that have been profiting from the war in Ukraine. 

Why is any of this relevant? 

UWaterloo has always had tax-exempt profits in tens of millions of dollars, while feigning poverty and showing overall non-profit margins, or even negative balance sheets from its operations by shifting its retained earnings into Trusts and Foundations controlled by UWaterloo employees (or their family members). UWaterloo's leadership, and its equity partners like the Barn Raisers, KW-Foundation, and the provincial government have always used UWaterloo's standing as an educational institution, to gouge profits from students by increasing the yearly tuition fees, for various programs by multiple folds; and by instilling a false sense of financial scarcity among its departments and faculty members to "decrease the university's bottom line." They have done so, by circumventing proper public disclosures of the accounts, balance sheets, and operations of UWaterloo's named as well as unnamed "Donation Funds, Trusts, and Foundations." The eventual result has been the establishment of a culture of hiring "insecure over-achievers" as staff and faculty members, who undervalue their sweat-equity, talents, and intellectual properties, all of which are constantly poured into the publicly funded university to "increase the university's top line." Those desperate faculty members in turn, recruit insecure over-achievers from around the globe as students and researchers, to fuel one of the largest, money-making-engines of the locality known as Kitchener-Waterloo Region, in Ontario, Canada. 

Is it supposed to be ironic, that a person like you advocates for preservation, and development of ecologically sensitive habitats and watersheds, with barely any funds, while the university negates your efforts by arming fossil fuel companies with tens of millions of dollars each year, to destroy those habitats and water bodies? No, it is just moronic, not ironic. It is merely the well-established culture in North America of orchestrating a resource grab while propping up somebody like you, to assuage the public with diplomatic words about interdisciplinary research in resource management, which is supposedly, slowly progressing towards preservation and betterment of natural heritage. However, you and the public are simply getting shafted. 

By the time anybody notices that a company like Nestle cheated Ontarians, and brazenly stole Ontario's potable water over decades, the irreparable damage gets done, and there remains no physical methods of reconciling the damage. So the only available option is to adopt paltry psychological and sociological excuses to lick those wounds, and "get over it," only to allow the same vicious cycle to repeat itself. 

You've most probably seen and experienced, having grown up in different countries of North America and Africa, how colonialism white-washed "Common Rape, Pillaging, and Plundering of The Earth" as, "Commonwealth Programs." Well, the educational program that was, and still is your half-sibling, is simply a fruit that hasn't managed to fall far from its institutional tree. 

When UWaterloo denied proper funding and support (as per its habitual pattern), for a center that was to improve the visibility of learning from engineering economics, industrial production, organizational psychology, and business administration — your father — out of desperation, went to the loan-sharks of the golden triad, I mean, the venture capitalists of the Golden Triangle. What did your father have to offer to them in exchange for their financial and social backing? Naming rights of the center that was going to be turned into a full-fledged school. 

Too bad, not all of the participating ~~loan-sharks~~ venture capitalists who founded the Conrad Center, received the particular naming rights and cultural capital that *they* so desperately wanted to acquire, for bolstering their individual legacies. Infighting, backbiting, legal-offshoring, and shenanigans ensued among the families who wanted their name on a plaque, mounted on the walls of a university building, all of which caused the quality of education offered by UWaterloo, as well as the educational priorities of the Conrad Center, to plummet. You would have witnessed many of those arguments and plenary discussions play out in your home's back-yard, or living room; and you most probably know those neighborly families that I'm speaking of, a little too well.I'm quite certain that there is some convenient way to normalize, intellectualize, and rationalize all of that as part of reality, and the unspoken truths that young learners need to be exposed to in life, so that each of us can identify our own strategy in dealing with it, or in making the most from of it.

The Conrad Center was never-the-less, internationally marketed and over-hyped by its administrators, and even government based authority figures from Universities Canada, with yearly increasing tuition fees for its business related degrees, while capitalizing on the fad of "entrepreneurship." And that was mainly done to appease the public and private financiers of the Conrad Center. Those financiers however, only cared for increasing financial returns on their initial investment, with abject disregard for the educational needs and priorities of abled as well as differently abled students who were baited by the center. The center's founders and program managers, naturally targeted more susceptible foreign students from developing economies to cater to their greed, and avoided marketing the Conrad Center's programs to under-serviced communities of Canada, simply because economically stunted students from Canadian communities attending 'premium educational programs' on fee waivers or scholarships, would not have served the personal financial interests of the center's backers. The proof of that is in the "Strategy Map" of the MBET program, which never considered the students ultimately impacted by the program, as a priority of any sort. 

Of course, the deriding rebukes from each of the cohort of students, who graduated with an MBET degree from UWaterloo during the past two decades, particularly from the international student graduates, speaks many more volumes about the bad quality of the over-hyped irregular degrees, doled out by UWaterloo, in the name of entrepreneurship. Those rebukes are far greater in strength and salty vitriol, than anything that even a verbose person like me could have ever produced. 

However, the self-cajoling biases and habits of Conrad Center's management, that have continued to cause the center to willfully ignore the scornful resentments of its alumni, year-after-year, have also caused the center to conveniently pick approximately 1 out of 25 students, to speak highly of its programs for marketing purposes. This is done to keep the center operating so that its managers and leadership can be well-paid and well-fed. Furthermore, the center only needs 1 out of 60 students over a period of four years, to appear as an "entrepreneurial success story," to keep driving its business model. Those are pretty good odds for obtaining hundreds of thousands of dollars in profit each year from an educational center, by cutting down on quality of courses wherever possible, by letting the rest of the students turn into road-kill, and by cranking up the marketing to justify business-school-level tuition fees for an irregular graduate study program. 

Perhaps your father just gave into the region's pipe-dream of seeking exponential riches that were supposed to come from ventures like Black Berry, which never quite materialized. Perhaps he merely wanted to keep up with the Joneses in hyping the quality of the declining Conrad Center, where the Joneses happened to be the business schools of University of Toronto, and Wilfrid Laurier University. Whatever might have been the case, and even though he had noble intentions and legitimate reasons for starting the center around twenty years ago, your father simply went along with the farce of the Conrad Center, once it was in full swing towards becoming a school at UWaterloo. 

So, you see, the ill-gotten gains obtained from students defrauded and conned by the Conrad Center during all those years, coincidentally, have been paying for keeping the lights on in your household, and in your offices. However, I do not have any intentions of having your father indicted for anything because I don't think he will be able to withstand the rigors of a courtroom in his current circumstances. Courthouses operated by mere mortals are reserved for the likes of the more underhanded, greedy managers and leaders, of entities like UWaterloo, and the Conrad School. Your father can instead say his piece to God, on his own terms, when he has made his peace with God, on his own accord.

The issue at hand is basically this: many of us who went through the Conrad Center (School) for a Master's level training and education in business, entrepreneurship, and technology, already came from a culture where we were made to acutely understand how and why, a **"tatemae"** (an official facade) veils, envelopes, and shrouds a **"honne"** (the underlying harsh truth). We were not looking for, nor did we need the Canadian versions of institutionalized hypocrisy and dishonesty, especially when we were strongly promised the exact opposite of under-funded, irregular, duplicitous, and illegitimate educational programs by Canada's educational system. 

>Worst of all, we did not expect nor did any of us need to be subjected to illegitimate detention; reproductive harms; electrically or chemically induced visceral injuries; unethical medical experimentation; degrading and devastating humiliations; state-sponsored murder attempts; home invasions; theft of private properties via attacks with cyber-warfare tools; various forms of harassment and intimidation from uniformed agencies; religious suppression and forced religious conversion under duress; closed-quarters spying activities by Canadian agents deployed to homes as well as places of worship of ethnic minorities; theft of economic opportunities and deprivation of legal statuses via hidden barriers; repeated betrayals of trust; human rights violations; or, any kind of price gauging or `gray-area activities` involving false advertisements and misleading endorsements, aside from other ongoing genocidal violations committed by public or private entities, that happen to surround UWaterloo in the Kitchener-Waterloo Region of Ontario, Canada.

Your father was able to enjoy the opportunity to have a spouse and kids, he was able to see you grow up, and to even have grandchildren. People like me won't get to have such basic opportunities, specifically and precisely because of the wicked and insidious activities perpetrated by bigoted and predatory violators in Canada, who use UWaterloo as a funnel and a conveyor belt to supply themselves with fresh batches of students to prey on, each year.

Harry, are you now able to properly see and understand, why you are currently sinking in the wake of UWaterloo's misdeeds and wrongdoings, as a piece of collateral damage? 

You are not expected to apologize for, nor be apologetic on behalf of, your father. You are merely one more person who has to bite the proverbial bullet; and to then get their house as well as offices into proper form, and order. My hope is that you will be able to continue your life and work in peace, after you have accepted, and come to terms with, the role of your half-sibling in your family's daily life. 

In the aftermath of the chain of events that are currently unfolding, UWaterloo will most probably not even bother to apologize to you, but may try to placate you with a bit more funding, without admitting guilt of any wrongdoing. You might as well demand all that is owed to you from the university's administrators because they are likely to skimp on it, if you don't chase after them, and fight for what is rightfully yours. 

However, one of the more important things that you need to do immediately, for your own sake, is to make sure that your father did not stash anything using any type of direct, discreet, or proxy actions — within places like Guernsey Island in the English Channel, off the coast of Normandy — for his friends and family.  

The sins of the father or the forefathers were never meant to be the sins of the progeny. And yet, children suffer from the burdens of the benefits as well as the shameful harms brought about through all that which can be inherited. There has never been a convenient way to launder inherited culture with normalized misappropriations, even if there have been quaint mechanisms to cheat the tax-collector, or to hoodwink the public's eye while consuming cherry-picked portions of inherited monies, from looting activities, that can be dressed up to look clean, earnest, and wholesome. 

There has simply never been **a way to honestly acknowledge** history's genuinely appreciable moments while hiding its inglorious and dreary ones. 

So, whose job is it to rectify the system? The current systems users and incumbent systems administrators have to fulfill the job of rectifying the system, obviously. Simply "kicking the can forward" is not a remedy of any sort, doing so only amplifies the inter-generational harms from systemic faults and human errors, which in turn, only cause further erosion of the next generation's trust and faith, in humanity's foundations.
