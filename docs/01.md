# 1. Systematized Harms and Systemic Wrongdoers 

> Systematization involves creating interactive links that produce a kinematic effect. A kinematic effect is observed when repeatable and precise actions of connected parts are achieved due to the way those parts are mutually linked.

> Linked parts are connected via a control structure so that signaling mechanisms and triggers can produce a particular range of movements with corresponding actions of the system's end-effectors, within the degrees of freedom of the parts linked to the controlling structure. Centralized or distributed control of a system can be achieved through different configurations of the network of linked parts, which feed into, and derive information from, the controlling structure.
